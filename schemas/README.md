# Schemas

This directory contains JSON Schemas for groundwork runtime artifacts and
authoring substrates. Most of these schemas are methodology-private and are
defined only in this repository.

`workflow-contract.schema.json` is an authoring substrate for C-2 workflow
contracts from ADR-0002. It is validated by `tooling.workflow_contracts`, not
declared as a runtime artifact type in `manifest.toml`.

`request.schema.json` is different: it is a vendored copy of the canonical
request contract maintained by `tesserine/commons`. Groundwork keeps the runtime
copy here so runtime consumers still read schemas from groundwork, not from
commons.

The vendored request schema carries provenance metadata identifying the
canonical authority, an immutable release-tag or commit-SHA URL for the
canonical schema and prose, and the request spec's full semver. When updating
the vendored copy, update both the schema content and the provenance metadata
together so conformance stays explicit.
